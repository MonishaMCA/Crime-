# Crime Management System
ABSTRACT
A crime management website is a web-based tool for safe and quick reporting, tracking, and resolution of criminal situations and for controlling city crime. The goal of crime management systems is to design user-friendly interfaces for reporting as well as getting access to complaint-related data. With the help of this software, you may report online crimes, file complaints, look up missing people, safety tips, the latest news, and see information about people who are wanted list. For the police department to identify societal issues without having to constantly have people visit the police station, This online crime management was created using PHP. The backend of a website, often known as server-side scripting, is where PHP really shines. PHP can send emails, generate dynamic website content, integrate with databases, create sessions, send and receive cookies, and receive input from forms, among other things. PHP is secure and dependable since it has several hash methods accessible to encrypt user data. This project shows how to take an interactive crime management website to the user. The website was created using PHP, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
INTRODUCTION


A crime management website serves as an essential platform for efficient and streamlined reporting, tracking, and resolution of criminal incidents. Crime management systems often leverage web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end to create user-friendly interfaces for reporting and accessing complaint-related information. By combining Angular as the frontend framework and Java as the backend language, you can create a robust and scalable architecture for the crime management website. The frontend and backend components can communicate via APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to exchange data and perform necessary operations. This approach allows for a separation of concerns, making the development process more organized and maintainable. Bootstrap, on the other hand, is a popular frontend framework that utilizes CSS, along with JavaScript, to streamline the process of building responsive and mobile-friendly web interfaces. The key features and benefits of a crime management website, highlighting its significance in enhancing the overall user can complaint from crime destination. In today's generation, the number of people using online systems is increasing rapidly and hence; online facilities can be used efficiently for personal security or various other protection purposes. This software provides a facility for reporting crimes online, registering complaints, entering missing persons, showing most wanted person details, news reporting, and chatting. Police can use this software to manage different crimes, and some of them are done in police stations manually. Police gets their login password from the admin directly. So this website helps police find out the problems in the society without them coming to the police station. Any number of clients can connect to the server. Each user first makes their login to the server to show their availability. A XAMPP Server must be maintained for the temporary storage of the database to enable the processing facilities. This project describes to used in MYSQL database and HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP coding has been used to design the website.




PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Scope of the project
In crime management system, it includes crime reporting and recording, criminal database management, and case management functionalities. The system will enable users to report crimes online, capturing critical details such as crime type, location, date, time, and supporting evidence. Law enforcement personnel will be able to manage and update cases, assign investigators, and monitor the progress of investigations through a user-friendly interface. Additionally, the system will maintain a comprehensive database of criminals, storing their personal information, criminal history, photographs, and other relevant data. This centralized criminal database will aid in identifying and apprehending repeat offenders, streamlining the process of matching suspects to criminal activities. By providing detailed analytics and reports, the system will empower decision-makers to allocate resources effectively and make data-driven decisions to address crime challenges. To ensure data security and privacy, the system will include robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms, limiting access to sensitive information to authorized personnel only.

Modules
Designing a Crime Management System project using web development in PHP involves creating a web application that allows users, police officers, administrators to manage and track criminal activities, cases, suspects, and other relevant data. Below, I'll outline a high-level system design for such a project:

Requirements Gathering: 
Understand the specific requirements of the Crime Management System. Identify the key features and functionalities that the system needs to support, such as case management, suspect tracking, crime report, user roles, etc.


Technology Stack: 
Choose the appropriate technology stack for web development. In this case, we'll use PHP for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Additionally, we'll use a relational database such as MySQL to store the application's data.

Database Design: 
Design the database schema to store information about crimes, cases, suspects, officers, safety tips, news etc. Consider the relationships between different entities and create the necessary tables with appropriate columns and constraints.

Backend Development: 
PHPÂ was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and a MySQL Database as the Back-End. Implement security measures like authentication and authorization to control access to certain functionalities based on user roles.

Frontend Development: Create the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the backend APIs. Design user-friendly and intuitive interfaces for crime reporting, case details, suspect information, etc. Implement client-side validation to ensure data integrity and improve user experience.

IMPLEMENTATION

      PHP for the back-end development and HTML5 for front-end development.Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting language. PHP stands for Personal Home Page and is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. We chose PHP because instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code What distinguishes PHP from something like clientside JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML, which is then sent to the client. The client would receive running that script but not know the underlying code. You can even configure your webserver to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.The best thing about using PHP is that it is straightforward.
XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database server, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server possible.
MySQL is a freely available open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is the most popular language for adding, accessing and managing a database. It is most noted for its quick processing, proven reliability, ease and flexibility of use.
